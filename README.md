Sandbox for experimenting with features, organizing concepts, and various techniques with Angular JS.

# Technology Stack

* NPM for dependency management (the defacto standard for package management)
* Grunt for build tool (it uses a imperative style, mirroring the problem space)
 * `grunt-contrib-copy` to move static files from `src/` to `dist/`
* Browserify for module inclusion (do it how node does)
 * [https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook]


# Setup

```
npm install
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```
